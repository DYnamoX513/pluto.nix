# Pluto's Nix Config (Flakes)

> [!WARNING]
> Currently Nixpkgs-unstable is really UNSTABLE on Darwin at least.
> neovim-0.10.3 [freezes](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/368247) in some circumstances while neovim from Homebrew does not.
> I decide to use Homebrew exclusively on Darwin.

## WIP...

Currently working on nix-darwin & home-manager  
Inspired by [Nix Darwin Kick-starter](https://github.com/ryan4yin/nix-darwin-kickstarter), 
[ryan4yin nix-config](https://github.com/ryan4yin/nix-config)

## TODO

- [ ] Secret management: ssh config, ssh-key, OATH (TOTP)key, etc.
- [ ] Alacritty: Another terminal emulator written in Rust
- [ ] Clean up programs installed by both Homebrew and home-manager (preferred)
- [ ] Miscellaneous files: .clang-tidy, .clang-format, harper-ls's dictionary, etc.
- [ ] Maybe NixOS/RHEL Linux w. Nix in OrbStack?
